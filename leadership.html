Someone didn't add monitoring system to a microservice before going live

## Ingedient I: Context
### I am sitting now in a coffee shop trying to figure out how our new service performs

## Ingedient II: Observations
### I was trying hard, but didn't find monitoring for the service

## Ingerdient III and IV: Emotions and Value
### I feel nervous, because we may miss the moment when things go wrong and lose our key customers. As per last post-mortem, we agreed that monitoring must be launched before golive.

---
## Ingredient V: Suggestions
### Please let me know if you need any assistance with adding the monitoring. I've also added "GoLive checklist" as an idea for the next retrospective.
